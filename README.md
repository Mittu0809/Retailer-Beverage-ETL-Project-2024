# Retailer-Beverage-ETL-Project-2024

This Excel ETL project focuses on processing and analyzing a retailer's beverage dataset. The project begins by merging four Excel files with retailer data, followed by data extraction, cleaning, and transformation using Power Query. The final output is an insightful pivot table showing beverage sales per retailer, with rows representing retailers, columns for beverage brands, and values for total revenue. This project highlights essential ETL skills in Excel and Power Query, optimized for retail data analysis.
